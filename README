Ruby/DB2: IBM DB2 Module for Ruby
Copyright (C) 2001 by Michael Neumann (neumann@s-direktnet.de)
Released under the same terms as Ruby itself.



PREREQUISITES
=============
* IBM DB2 installed (with CLI), tested with DB2 V7.1 on Suse Linxu 6.3 and
  DB2 UDB V6.1 for Windows 95/98/NT.
* Ruby, only tested with Ruby 1.6.3, but should work with every version >= 1.6.
* C-Compiler


INSTALL
=======
To compile type the following:

  ruby setup.rb config
  ruby setup.rb setup

If you get an error message that no libraries and header files were found, then
you have to set DB2DIR to the correct path where DB2 was installed, e.g.:

  export DB2DIR=/usr/IBMdb2/V7.1

or under Cygwin and DB2 installed in C:\SQLLIB:

  export DB2DIR=C:/SQLLIB

To install, make sure you are the superuser (under UNIX type "su -l root")
and then type:

  ruby setup.rb install

For more options on installation, type:

  ruby setup.rb --help


The DB2 library files are installed in your site_ruby directory,
of the actual ruby-version (e.g. "site_ruby/1.6") under the 
directory "db2" and the .so file under "$arch/db2", where $arch 
is your architecure (e.g. i686-linux).


DOCUMENTATION
=============
Not yet written.

You should consult the DB2-CLI manual available from IBM's website and 
look at the comments before each function in the file "ext/db2/db2cli.c". 

The rule of thumb is that all parameters in the DB2-CLI manual which are 
declared as "output" or "input/output" are returned by the function (in an array). 
All input values which are of type HANDLE (HENV, HDBC, HSTMT...) are represented by 
Integer parameters in the Ruby version.


SAMPLES
=======
See directory "samples".
